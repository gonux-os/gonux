# GoNUX Monorepo
This repo serves the purpose of aiding development by importing the linux kernel as a submodule and providing a folder structure to easily compile and run GoNUX software on top of the kernel.

Over time, as the GoNUX programs begin to gain shape, their individual folders will be converted into separate repos and imported here as submodules.
