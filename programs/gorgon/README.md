# Gorgon

*Display server*

## About

A display server, similar to Xorg or Wayland, written in Go using the Linux kernel's DRM drivers.

A major goal of this project is to provide an X server compatible interface, allowing any graphical X application to run on Gorgon.

If we can run OpenGL on Gorgon then we've made it.
